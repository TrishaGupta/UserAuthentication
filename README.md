# User Authentication System

This repository contains a user authentication system built using Node.js, React, and MongoDB. The system allows users to sign up, log in, and access protected routes with authentication.

## Features

- User registration: Users can sign up by providing their email and password.
- User login: Registered users can log in with their credentials.
- Password hashing: User passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.
- Protected routes: Certain routes are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.
- JWT-based authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication and authorization.
- MongoDB integration: User data is stored in a MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- MongoDB

## Usage

1. Sign up with your email and password to create a new user account.
2. Log in with your credentials to access the protected routes.
3. Navigate to the protected routes and interact with the application as an authenticated user.

## How to user
1. Open terminal and navigate to auth.
2. Run npm run dev - it runs both the backend and frontend concurrently.
